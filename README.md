##Clicky Game - Street Fighter edition!

## Brief App description

This app is a memory game with React. This project required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## How to play the game
1. The application renders a dozen different images from Street Fighter to the screen.

2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once.

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented

4. If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.

5. The application keeps track of the users Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score. Get all 12 and you win the game.
